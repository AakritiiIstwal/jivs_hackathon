## Cross-Database Schema & Value mapping
In the modern data-centric environment, organizations frequently utilize multiple database systems to store, manage, and analyze their data. These databases can vary significantly in terms of structure, terminology, and design principles. When integrating
data from different sources, it becomes challenging for users, especially those unfamiliar with the specific systems, to identify similarities between tables and understand their structures. Manually exploring and mapping the schemas of numerous tables across
different databases is a time-consuming and error-prone process.

## Challenge Requirement
We are seeking innovative solutions to develop a program/tool that can automate the process of schema mapping between different databases. It should help users identify tables and columns with similar structures and suggest potential mappings, making it
easier to integrate and compare data from diverse sources.
