DATA_TYPE_OWNER,VARCHAR2(128),Owner of the data type of the column
DATA_LENGTH,NUMBER,Length of the column (in bytes)
DATA_PRECISION,NUMBER,Decimal precision for NUMBER data type; binary precision for FLOAT data type; NULL for all other data types
DATA_SCALE,NUMBER,Digits to the right of the decimal point in a number
NULLABLE,VARCHAR2(1),Indicates whether a column allows NULLs. The value is N if there is a NOT NULL constraint on the column or if the column is part of a PRIMARY KEY. The constraint should be in an ENABLE VALIDATE state.
COLUMN_ID,NUMBER,Sequence number of the column as created
DEFAULT_LENGTH,NUMBER,Length of the default value for the column
DATA_DEFAULT,LONG,Default value for the column
NUM_DISTINCT,NUMBER,Number of distinct values in the column
LOW_VALUE,RAW(1000),Low value in the column
HIGH_VALUE,RAW(1000),High value in the column
DENSITY,NUMBER,"If a histogram is available on COLUMN_NAME, then this column displays the selectivity of a value that spans fewer than 2 endpoints in the histogram. It does not represent the selectivity of values that span 2 or more endpoints. If a histogram is not available on COLUMN_NAME, then the value of this column is 1/NUM_DISTINCT."
NUM_NULLS,NUMBER,Number of NULLs in the column
NUM_BUCKETS,NUMBER,"Number of buckets in the histogram for the column. Note: The number of buckets in a histogram is specified in the SIZE parameter of the ANALYZE SQL statement. However, Oracle Database does not create a histogram with more buckets than the number of rows in the sample. Also, if the sample contains any values that are very repetitious, Oracle Database creates the specified number of buckets, but the value indicated by this column may be smaller because of an internal compression algorithm."
LAST_ANALYZED,DATE,Date on which this column was most recently analyzed
SAMPLE_SIZE,NUMBER,Sample size used in analyzing this column
CHARACTER_SET_NAME,VARCHAR2(44),"Name of the character set: CHAR_CS, NCHAR_CS"
CHAR_COL_DECL_LENGTH,NUMBER,Declaration length of the character type column
GLOBAL_STATS,VARCHAR2(3),"GLOBAL_STATS will be YES if statistics are gathered or incrementally maintained, otherwise it will be NO"
USER_STATS,VARCHAR2(3),Indicates whether statistics were entered directly by the user (YES) or not (NO)
AVG_COL_LEN,NUMBER,Average length of the column (in bytes)
CHAR_LENGTH,NUMBER,"Displays the length of the column in characters. This value only applies to the following data types: CHAR, VARCHAR2, NCHAR, NVARCHAR2"
CHAR_USED,VARCHAR2(1),"Indicates that the column uses BYTE length semantics (B) or CHAR length semantics (C), or whether the data type is not any of the following (NULL): CHAR, VARCHAR2, NCHAR, NVARCHAR2"
V80_FMT_IMAGE,VARCHAR2(3),Indicates whether the column data is in release 8.0 image format (YES) or not (NO)
DATA_UPGRADED,VARCHAR2(3),Indicates whether the column data has been upgraded to the latest type version format (YES) or not (NO)

DEFAULT_ON_NULL,VARCHAR2(3),Indicates whether the column has DEFAULT ON NULL semantics (YES) or not (NO)
IDENTITY_COLUMN,VARCHAR2(3),Indicates whether this is an identity column (YES) or not (NO)

UNUSABLE_BEFORE,VARCHAR2(128),Name of the oldest edition in which the index may be used as part of a query plan
UNUSABLE_BEGINNING,VARCHAR2(128),Name of the edition for which the index may not be used as part of a query plan in this edition or any of its descendants
COLLATION,VARCHAR2(100),Collation for the column. Only applies to columns with character data types.
